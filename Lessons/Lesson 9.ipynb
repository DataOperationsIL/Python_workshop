    "# Most Experimental Lesson of the workshop - How to label with LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disclaimer for those who do not know me:\n",
    "* I'm no professional instructor\n",
    "* This was written while I was working on something so everything's jumbled\n",
    "* This is not a full-on demonstration, i simplified things for the sake of keeping it small and timely\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "* This is all a result of my trial and error\n",
    "* Of course context changes everything\n",
    "* We're working with Ollama because it's free, in a workplace you'll probably be able to use APIs, other than initial setup and using different functions (functions are per API) the work is pretty much the same\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concepts to keep in mind:\n",
    "* Golden set/ground truth - it'll be super helpful if we have a correctly labeled dataset to compare results against\n",
    "* Do not attempt to do 2 things at once with LLMs, always break up the task as much as possible - instead of 1 questions with 2 parts do 2 questions separately, first extract a response and only afterwards parse it, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "### My lessons learned the hard way:\n",
    "* Label simple questions, I call it 10-agorot questions\n",
    "* Do not prompt engineer here. The simpler the better. Ask a direct question with direct answers.\n",
    "* You can break down a complex question to simple questions for better results. LLMs are not smart. Treat them like crowd labelers\n",
    "* If you run an LLM down a big dataset, no matter what, eventually you get weird answers, so keep the labeling in small chunks\n",
    "* Structure your output in a way you can QA it later\n",
    "* Ask for your output on a scale (even number) so that you have also the correctness info and also how clear-cut it is.\n",
    "* Scale slowly. I find it convenient to start with a few examples, edit prompt until that's ok, then a small sample (lets say 150 lines), use them as a golden set to iterate until you have a good enough process, then you can check it on a larger sample\n",
    "* Something that really helps improve quality: ask for the reasoning first and the score/answer after (learned this in PyData!!!)\n",
    "* To make manual inspection quicker and less confusing - work by category, such as positive predictions (and then mark as true or false positive - which is by the way a decision that needs to be made, what consitutes a true positive), and utilize any other data you might have (previous checks, other sources of truth..)\n",
    "* I have this feeling that there's always going to be a data category that the process just won't work for, and it's better to try to identify it and remove it from the dataset for LLM labeling\n",
    "\n",
    "### how to work towards a goal:\n",
    "* evaluate data and how much you can improve, there will always be a small number of false positives/negatives, decide what you care about more (it's a context/business decision)\n",
    "* I haven't done yet any process that goes directly to production, it always stops on the way at a human station, so part of my goal is to make it easier for the human to read/understand\n",
    "* Easier said than done: keep documentation of what you tried and how well it worked, it will really help later to explain your decisions to non-believers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Avenues I haven't explored yet:\n",
    "* Difference when putting info in the system prompt vs. regular prompt\n",
    "* Ask for output in natural language and parse myself later (example output: review mentions brand, review does not mention brand)\n",
    "* Finetuning a small model for specific labeling tasks (did it at ebay with a big model, but i also had there a convenient platform and lots of resources)\n"
